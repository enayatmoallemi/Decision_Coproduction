 ## Abstract
 Decision-making under uncertainty is important for managing human-natural systems in a changing world. A major source of uncertainty that challenges decisions is rooted in their multi-actor settings, i.e., the poorly understood societal actors with diverse values, complex relationships, and conflicting management approaches. Despite general agreement across disciplines on co-producing knowledge for viable and inclusive outcomes in multi-actor settings, there is still limited conceptual clarity and no systematic understanding on what co-production means in decision-making under uncertainty and how it can be achieved. Here, we use content analysis and clustering to systematically analyse 50 decision-making cases with multiple time and spatial scales across 26 countries and in 9 different sectors in the last decade to serve two aims. The first is to synthesise the key recurring approaches that underpin high quality decision co-production across many cases of diverse features. The second is to identify important deficits and opportunities to leverage existing approaches towards flourishing co-production in supporting decision-making. We find that four general approaches emerge centred around: promoting innovation for robust and equitable decisions; broadening the span of co-production across interacting systems; fostering social learning and inclusive participation; and improving pathways to impact. Additionally, five key areas that should be addressed to improve decision co-production are identified in relation to: participation diversity; social learning; power relationships; governance inclusivity; and transformative change. Characterising the emergent approaches and their key areas for improvement can help guide future works towards more pluralistic and integrated science and practice.

 

 ## Dependencies
 You'll need GeoPandas to run the code. You'll also need Python *3.7.6* to run the code.
 You can set up an environment with all dependencies using an environment manager
 like [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which
 provides the `conda` package manager.
 Anaconda can be installed in your user directory and does not interfere with
 the system Python installation.
